# Deployment Guide - OpenCV Fix

## Problem
You're encountering an OpenCV import error during deployment:
```
ImportError: This app has encountered an error. The original error message is redacted to prevent data leaks.
Traceback:
File "/mount/src/intel_ai_project/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    import cv2
```

## Solution

### 1. Update Requirements.txt
Replace `opencv-python` with `opencv-python-headless` in your `requirements.txt`:

```txt
streamlit==1.28.1
opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78
numpy==1.24.3
Pillow==10.0.1
tensorflow==2.13.0
torch==2.0.1
torchvision==0.15.2
ultralytics==8.0.196
transformers==4.33.2
scikit-learn==1.3.0
matplotlib==3.7.2
seaborn==0.12.2
pandas==2.0.3
requests==2.31.0
kaggle==1.5.16
```

### 2. For Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. **Use the updated requirements.txt** (already fixed above)
2. **Ensure your app.py has the OpenCV fallback** (already implemented)
3. **Deploy using the headless version**

### 3. For Local Deployment

Run these commands:
```bash
pip uninstall opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78
```

### 4. Alternative: Use requirements-deploy.txt

For cloud deployments, use the optimized requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-deploy.txt
```

## Why This Happens

- **opencv-python** includes GUI dependencies that aren't available in cloud environments
- **opencv-python-headless** is a lightweight version without GUI dependencies
- Cloud platforms like Streamlit Cloud don't have display servers

## What's Been Fixed

1. ✅ **Updated requirements.txt** to use `opencv-python-headless`
2. ✅ **Added OpenCV import error handling** in app.py
3. ✅ **Created fallback detection** using PIL when OpenCV is unavailable
4. ✅ **Updated all OpenCV functions** to check availability
5. ✅ **Created deployment-optimized requirements**

## Testing

After deployment:
1. The app should start without import errors
2. If OpenCV is available: Full functionality
3. If OpenCV is not available: Basic PIL-based detection with clear warnings

## Next Steps

1. Update your deployment with the new requirements.txt
2. Redeploy your application
3. Test the functionality

The application will now work in both environments:
- **With OpenCV**: Full computer vision capabilities
- **Without OpenCV**: Basic image analysis with PIL fallback
